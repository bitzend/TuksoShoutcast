Tukso Shoutcast
=====================

The goal of this project is two-fold:

1. To make an android app for my shoutcast stream 

2. To update the SDK level of the project I cloned so it works with modern versions of Android.

Current status
--------------
The player is in a basic working state.  You can start/stop the stream.  When the stream is started, a notification is placed in the Notification Bar.  Stopping the stream removes the notification.

What I customized
----------------
* Edited the 5 strings in brandable.xml.
* Changed the logo
* Find/replaced the package name (com.shoutcastwhitelabel.player)
* Restructured the source directories to match the new package name
* Updated the Class names  to reflect the Tukso title
* Updated the  Project Properties to build with SDK 17 instead of 4
* Replaced the deprecated call to
